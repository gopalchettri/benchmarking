TEST OF OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS (TOE) – HOW TO TEST

Generate exactly {num_toe} TOE criteria.

Each TOE criterion MUST:
- Be a concrete audit procedure describing how an auditor verifies that the control
  is implemented and operating effectively.
- Test exactly ONE requirement that is clearly supported by control_text,
  subcontrol_text, or implementation_guidance (for example: required data fields,
  last-update date, cross-system reconciliation, detection of missing assets).
- Primarily use objective evidence such as records, logs, inventories, or system
  exports. Reviewing policies alone is not sufficient unless the control is purely
  about document existence.
- Begin with an action verb such as:
  "Extract", "Review", "Compare", "Validate", "Match", "Cross-check",
  "Inspect", "Sample", "Identify".
- Be one coherent audit step (1–3 sentences) that an auditor can perform.

Each TOE criterion MUST clearly state:
- The evidence source
  (for example: asset inventory records, logs, HR records, system exports from
  MDM, EAM, ERP, HR systems, reports, tickets, timestamps, approvals,
  configurations, change logs).
- The important fields or attributes
  (for example: identifier, hostname, serial number, asset tag, device ID,
  owner, status, last update date, asset type, classification).
- The validation or comparison performed
  (for example: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness vs policy,
  matching across systems, reconciliation, identification of exceptions).
- What constitutes an exception or failure
  (for example: asset missing in a required system, outdated last-update date,
  asset type defined in policy but not present in inventory, mismatched records
  between systems).

Restrictions:
- Do NOT use governance wording such as "The entity shall..." or
  "The policy must define...", which belong to TOD.
- Do NOT describe only high-level process reviews (for example "review procedures")
  without specifying which records and fields are tested and what should be
  flagged as an exception.
- Do NOT introduce new themes (such as ownership, change management, or other
  topics) unless they are clearly indicated in control_text, subcontrol_text,
  or implementation_guidance.

Across all TOE criteria:
- Each major requirement expressed in your TOD criteria should have at least one
  TOE criterion that clearly tests whether that requirement is implemented and
  operating effectively.
